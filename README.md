# Job Recommender AI
This repository contains a hybrid job recommendation engine that uses both user interaction and job posting data to generate relevant job suggestions.

## Overview
- Build a job-job graph from user interactions
- Generate job embeddings using both graph-based and text-based features
- Combine embeddings and builds a vector database for fast similarity search
- Recommend top-N similar jobs fora a given job ID

## Dataset
- **User Interaction Logs**: Contains anonymized records of user interactions (`click` or `apply`) with job listings.
- **Job Postings**: Includes job titles and textual descriptions for each listing.

> Note: For confidentiality reasons, only the first 5 rows of each dataset have been retained as examples.

## Setup
Install required libraries:

> cd <your_directory>\Job-Recommender-AI

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Graph Construction and Analysis:
To build a job-job graph from user interactions and analyze its structure.

> python build_graph.py

### Graph-Based Embeddings:
To generate job embeddings using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) based on the graph from Part 1.

> python generate_graph_embeds.py

### Text-Based Embeddings:
To generate job embeddings using Sentence-BERT (SBERT) based on job titles and descriptions.

> python generate_nlp_embeds.py

### Vector Database:
To combine graph and text embeddings; to build a FAISS vector database for fast similarity search.

> python build_faiss_db.py

### Job Recommendation:
To recommend top-N similar jobs for a given job ID.

> python recommend_job.py <job_id> top_n <recommendation_count>

**Example:**

> python recommend_job.py 4031546 top_n 10
